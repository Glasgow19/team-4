As the time is limited, so the functionality of the notifications of availability of the devices(Like wheel chairs, translators etc) for users are not fully implemented. Only simple backend logic is implemented. If more time allowed, the plan is to store the date and time of borrowing a device. And it allows front-end to implement the Data visualisation technique to show a line/time graph for users, which shows the number of available devices at a particular time of a day against other times in the day, and the number of available devices on a day of a wekk against other days in the week. The visualisation should help users to know what time they are more likely to get a device from the Science center. Hence people who has a need on the device could better plan for their trip to the Science center.
