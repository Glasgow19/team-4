It consists of an armchair, touchscreen, barcode scanner, and a wall-graphic about the heart. The armchair has three metal sensors: a flat sensor where the visitor sits and a ‘dome’ sensor on each armrest.","The visitor activates the exhibit by either pressing the touchscreen or by scanning their My BodyWorks barcode card. During the test, the visitor sits back in the armchair, with their hands placed on each armrest sensor. The visitor must remain still to prevent the sensors detecting the electrical activity of their muscles (other than their heart muscle). During the test, the visitor can see a graph of the electrical activity of their heart: their heart trace. The visitor can save their graph to their My BodyWorks profile.","• Encourage use of the My BodyWorks cards by explaining how they work and highlighting the benefits of using the website.• Discuss the clinical uses of ECG machines (see below).• Try asking thought-provoking questions related to the visitor, such as ‘why do you think your heart uses electrical signals?’, ‘how do you keep your heart healthy?’ or ‘why would a doctor measure your heart with an ECG?’","(From the British Heart Foundation)An ECG – or electrocardiogram - is a simple and useful test which records the rhythm and electrical activity of your heart. Small sticky patches called electrodes will be put onto your arms, legs and chest. These are connected to an ECG recording machine which picks up the electrical signals that make your heart beat. The test will only take a few minutes and is painless.  An ECG can detect problems you may have with your heart rhythm. It can help doctors tell if you are having a heart attack or if you’ve had a heart attack in the past. Sometimes an ECG can indicate if your heart is enlarged or thickened.",TRUE,ecg.JPG,0,1,0,1,1Virtual Autopsy: What lies hidden under the skin?,Virtual Autopsy Table / C3.03,Floor 3 - 08 Getting under your skin,An exhibit that allows visitors to explore the inside of three humans through medical visualisation tools. It consists of a 55” multitouch screen mounted at an angle against a wall. The scans were taken of real people using Computed Tomography (CT) technology.,"The visitor activates the exhibit by pressing the touchscreen. They are given the choice of three specimens to examine. The visitor can view different layers of the body (such as bones, fat, gas) by pressing a button along the bottom of the screen. The visitor can move and rotate the specimen using a finger and zoom in and out using two fingers. A sectioning tool allows visitors to slice through the body. Information points are found through the specimens and are opened by pressing an ‘i’ symbol. A home button at the bottom left resets the exhibit.","• Compare the different ways of learning from real bodies, which are illustrated in the capsule with this exhibit (3D scans) and the Human torso (dissection).• Offer assistance on how to play the game, as you highlight key learning outcomes tailored to the visitor.• Suggest related exhibits: ‘If you liked this, you’ll love this’","'Inside Explorer' is a powerful visualization system that gives visitors to museums and science centres the chance to virtually interact with subjects that have been scanned using medical imaging systems such as Computer Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). A large interactive touch screen enables visitors to enlarge, rotate and virtually dissect different examples on the table and explore them in intricate detail.  Originally developed to support forensic autopsy work, the first prototype of the Virtual Autopsy Table was developed in 2009 by Interactive Institute Swedish ICT, Visualization Center C and CMIV.  Today, the visualization system has found a new user base by providing amazing visualization experiences to visitors at science centres and museums. Anything that can be scanned can also be visualized, explored and used as basis for an interactive visitor experience – from meteorites to ancient mummies.",TRUE,autopsytable.JPG,0,1,0,1,1X-ray viewer,A7.17,Floor 3 - 13 Musculoskeletal,"An exhibit that allows visitors to investigate a range of real X-ray images. It consists of a wall-mounted lightbox, a range of X-ray graphics and storage trays. The lightbox features a grabber along the top to hold the X-rays in place. The X-rays are real and have had information overlaid.","The visitor selects an X-ray graphic from a tray and places it into the lightbox grabber. The visitor can try to spot the interesting parts in each X-ray, from fractured bones to swallowed objects.","• Offer to help visitors find the interesting part in each X-ray.• Ask visitors if they have had an X-ray before.• Suggest related exhibits: ‘If you liked this, you’ll love this’",The X-rays were donated Prof Sue Black.,TRUE,xrayviewer.JPG,0,1,1,1,1Bionic Body information screen,C7.08,Floor 3 - 14 Your bionic body,"An information screen that allows visitors to explore the latest advances in prosthetics and biomechanics. It consists of a touchscreen, pair of headphones and moveable stool. The exhibit features 6 articles, news RSS feeds and an acknowledgments page. Articles contain text, images and videos.","On approach, the exhibit displays an overview article. Visitors tap the scroll buttons to read through the article. Further articles can be selected from the column on the right-hand side of the screen. News articles appear along the bottom of the screen.","• Explain to visitors that they are standing in an area showcasing some of the ways science is working on bionics and prosthetics (see the text on the capsule welcome panels).• Point out that many of the stories featured on this screen are related to the surrounding objects, displays and interactive exhibits.",The information on this screen is updateable.,TRUE,bionicbody.JPG,0,1,1,1,1
